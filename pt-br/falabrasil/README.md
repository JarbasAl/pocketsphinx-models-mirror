unfortunately i don't have details about this model

this was in my hard-drive, at some point the old fala brasil website was 
taken down and this was provided in a forum as coming from there

i believe it is an older version of LapsAM, i have no information about the 
language model, training corpus, or dictionary used, this all came from a .
zip file
